        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">Pre-BusinessðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My Name is Hui Jun Lee and I am currently a Pre-Business major at the 
        University of California, Riverside planning to obtain admission to the business program and
        concentrate in Finance. I am origingally from Los Alamitos, California in orange county, 
        but I have grown up all throughout different parts of California. My intial interest in Business
        grwe when my twin brother and I thought of the idea to create a Amazon Business. We were able to create
        a e-commerece business by sourcing custom goods from China and having them sold on Amazon through its FBA program.<br><br>

        Through these experiences, I was able to learn the different traits and mindsets that are needed to run a business, and
        it brought me greater awareness of how the business world actually operated. We were able to achieve great success as
        we made sure that our profits and methods were inline with the goals we had set. Being the son fo first generation immigrant parents 
        have taught me many lessons that I could take use of in business applications, and many of the mindsets toward life have
        gifted me a greater perspective on how we can solve any of the issues at hand. 
        Another activity that sparked an interest in this career is the moment that I discovered the real estate market. 
        My father was a real estate agent, but I could not help but marvel at many of the opportunities existed in this field. I realized after learning about the methods in which 
        the real estate industry works that many of the same principles that I learned with my e-commerced business existed in real estate as well. 
        <br><br>

        After listening to the advice my father gave me on the benfits of working in this industry, I knew that I wanted to extend my interests into real estate. I started my journey
        into ths industry by taking a few courses that are required to become a licensed agent, and I was thrilled to learn that I could gain work experience throughout my college career working
        as a real estate agent because one of the few requirement was that you had to be 18 years of age. I quickly finished my preaprations for the license and was able to recieve my liecense in about
        half a year. I am now continuing my real estte journey that I have only began and hope that my apirations will lead to many great experiecnes and self-growth. In the future, I hope to be able
        to work in the investment field because that is where the root of my interests lie. While I may not have all the qualities nessary yet due to my lack of experience, I will try my bets to give my 
        full effort, and hopoe ot impact not only myself, but also those around me in a positive way.
